                <p id="tribute-info"><b>"Ada Lovelace was born in London, in 1815. She was a mathematician who worked on a mechanical general-purpose computer known as the Analytical Engine. Among other bright successes, she recognized that the machine could go way beyond simple and pure calculations, publishing then the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine like this one.<br><br><em>"A new, a vast, and a powerful language is developed for the future use of analysis, in which to wield its truths so that these may become of more speedy and accurate practical application for the purposes of mankind than the means hitherto in our possession have rendered possible. Thus not only the mental and the material, but the theoretical and the practical in the mathematical world, are brought into more intimate and effective connection with each other." â€“ Ada Lovelace</b></em></p><br><br>
